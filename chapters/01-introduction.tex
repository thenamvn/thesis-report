\section{Background of the Study}
\label{sec:intro_background}
The landscape of global education is undergoing a seismic transformation, a process significantly accelerated by recent worldwide events and the relentless pace of technological innovation. The traditional paradigm of classroom-based instruction is increasingly being augmented, and in many cases replaced, by digital learning environments. This has propelled e-learning from a niche alternative to a mainstream pillar of educational delivery across academic, corporate, and vocational sectors. However, the rapid migration to online platforms has also cast a harsh light on the limitations of first-generation systems. Many of these platforms were designed as little more than digital repositories for static content, leading to passive, uninspiring learning experiences that result in high dropout rates and a demonstrable lack of student engagement \citep{lee2011}.

In response to these deficiencies, two powerful technological and pedagogical trends have emerged as catalysts for the next generation of e-learning: \textbf{gamification} and \textbf{artificial intelligence (AI)}. Gamification, the strategic application of game-design elements and principles in non-game contexts, has been empirically shown to enhance learner motivation, knowledge retention, and overall engagement by tapping into intrinsic human desires for achievement, competition, and social connection \citep{deterding2011}. By embedding elements such as points, leaderboards, mission-based objectives, and tangible rewards, educators can transform learning from a passive chore into an active, enjoyable pursuit.

Concurrently, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of generative models and natural language processing (NLP), are unlocking unprecedented opportunities to automate, personalize, and enrich educational content. AI can now function as a powerful assistant for educators, capable of generating diverse, high-quality assessment questions, adapting content difficulty to individual learner needs, and providing instantaneous feedback. This technological leverage not only alleviates the significant administrative and content-creation burden on educators but also paves the way for a more tailored, efficient, and effective learning journey for students \citep{zawacki2019}.

This thesis is situated at the confluence of these transformative trends. It is motivated by the critical need for a modern e-learning platform that moves beyond mere content delivery to offer a holistic, intelligent, and deeply engaging educational ecosystem. The TEKUTOKO project was conceived to address this need by designing and constructing a platform that synergistically integrates mission-based gamification with powerful AI-driven content generation, all underpinned by a robust, scalable, and modern software architecture.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro_problem}
Despite the rapid proliferation of e-learning solutions, their effectiveness is frequently undermined by a set of persistent and interconnected challenges. This research identifies and directly addresses four primary problems that hinder the potential of digital education:

\subsection{Low User Engagement in Conventional E-Learning}
Many platforms fail to capture and sustain learner interest, leading to passive consumption of information rather than active, cognitive participation. This lack of engagement is a primary contributor to poor learning outcomes and high attrition rates \citep{fredricks2004}. The absence of interactive, motivating, and socially engaging elements makes online learning feel isolating and tedious.

\subsection{High Content Creation Overhead for Educators}
The process of creating high-quality, diverse, and stimulating educational content—especially varied quizzes, assessments, and interactive activities—is an exceptionally time-consuming and labor-intensive task for educators. This significant overhead often leads to a reliance on static, repetitive materials that quickly become outdated, fail to challenge learners appropriately, and are easily shared, compromising assessment integrity.

\subsection{Pervasive Academic Dishonesty in Online Assessments}
The remote and often unsupervised nature of online testing presents profound challenges to upholding academic integrity. It is exceedingly difficult to prevent various forms of cheating, such as unauthorized collaboration, use of external resources (e.g., search engines, notes), or identity misrepresentation. This issue erodes the validity of online assessments and devalues the qualifications obtained through them. While sophisticated proctoring solutions exist, they frequently entail high costs, technical complexity, and significant user privacy concerns \citep{ullah2021}.

\subsection{Architectural Rigidity of Monolithic EdTech Systems}
Many legacy and even contemporary e-learning systems are built using monolithic architectures, where all functional components are tightly coupled into a single, large codebase. While seemingly simpler to develop initially, these systems become exceedingly difficult to scale, update, and maintain as they grow. This architectural rigidity stifles innovation, slows the deployment of new features, and makes the entire system vulnerable to failure if a single component malfunctions \citep{newman2015}.

This thesis posits that these four problems are not independent but are deeply intertwined. The TEKUTOKO platform is therefore designed as a holistic solution to address these interconnected challenges simultaneously.

\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:intro_objectives}
The primary objective of this research is to design, implement, and rigorously evaluate the TEKUTOKO platform, a multifaceted e-learning system featuring deep gamification, AI-driven content generation, integrated proctoring, and a scalable microservice architecture.

To achieve this overarching goal, the following specific objectives are defined:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{To design and develop a web platform that integrates deep gamification principles} (e.g., mission-based rooms, competitive leaderboards, digital vouchers, and location-based discovery) to demonstrably enhance user engagement and motivation.
    \item \textbf{To implement and evaluate an AI-powered module} that automatically generates diverse, high-quality quiz questions from educator-provided topics or documents, aiming to significantly reduce the content creation workload.
    \item \textbf{To integrate a non-invasive, browser-based anti-cheating system} (proctoring) capable of monitoring and logging suspicious activities like tab-switching and user inactivity to improve the integrity of online assessments.
    \item \textbf{To architect the entire system using a microservice-based approach} to ensure high levels of scalability, maintainability, and resilience, providing a robust foundation for future expansion.
    \item \textbf{To empirically evaluate the platform's effectiveness} through a mixed-methods approach, measuring its impact on user engagement, educator efficiency, system performance, and the quality of its core features.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:intro_questions}
This research aims to provide evidence-based answers to the following key questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} To what extent does the integration of gamified, mission-based activities and reward systems within the TEKUTOKO platform improve user engagement and perceived usability when compared to traditional e-learning interfaces?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} How effective and reliable is the AI-driven question generation module in producing pedagogically sound and contextually relevant assessment content, and to what degree does it reduce the time and effort required for educators to create online tests?
