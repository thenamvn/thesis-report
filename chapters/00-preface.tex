The rapid digital transformation of the global education sector has created an urgent need for e-learning platforms that are not only informative but also engaging, scalable, and secure. Traditional online learning systems frequently struggle with low student motivation, static content delivery, and significant challenges in upholding academic integrity during remote assessments. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and comprehensive evaluation of TEKUTOKO, a novel web-based educational platform engineered to address these critical shortcomings through the synergistic integration of gamification, artificial intelligence, and a distributed microservice-based architecture.

The TEKUTOKO system provides a rich, interactive environment where educators can design and host "game rooms" or secure "test rooms". A cornerstone innovation of this platform is the AI Question Generator, a robust module that leverages Google's advanced Gemini Pro API to automate the creation of diverse and contextually relevant quiz questions from topics or existing documents, thereby significantly reducing the content creation burden for educators.

To foster sustained user motivation, TEKUTOKO incorporates a comprehensive gamification and reward mechanism, empowering hosts to issue digital vouchers which can be verified via QR codes. A location-based discovery feature utilizes GPS to help users find nearby educational events, promoting community engagement. To safeguard the credibility of online assessments, a non-invasive, browser-based proctoring system is implemented to monitor and flag suspicious user behaviors, such as tab switching and prolonged inactivity. The platform is architected upon a modern, high-performance technology stack, featuring a React.js frontend, a core Node.js backend, a specialized Python microservice for document processing, a MySQL database, and Firebase for storage, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

This research rigorously evaluates the TEKUTOKO platform through a series of controlled experiments measuring system performance, user engagement via the System Usability Scale (SUS), educator efficiency, and the efficacy of the anti-cheating system. The findings conclusively demonstrate that the strategic integration of these technologies leads to a statistically significant improvement in user satisfaction, engagement, and assessment integrity. This thesis contributes a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for developing next-generation e-learning systems that are interactive, intelligent, and secure.
